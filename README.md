# Network-Labs: A Cisco Packet Tracer Portfolio

This repository is a public portfolio of my network simulation projects created using Cisco Packet Tracer. It serves to document my hands-on practice in network design, configuration, and troubleshooting.

## 🚀 About This Repository

Welcome! As I progress in my network engineering studies, I use these labs to build and solidify my understanding of core networking concepts. Each file or folder represents a specific scenario, from basic setup to more complex enterprise-level challenges.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* **Cisco Packet Tracer:** All labs are created and simulated using this tool. You will need to have Packet Tracer installed on your machine to open the `.pkt` files.

## 🔬 Lab Directory

Here is a list of the labs currently in this repository.

### 1. Basic Subnetting (2 Subnets)

* **File:** `Subnetting Basic Lab 1.pkt`
* **Description:** This lab demonstrates how to subnet a `/24` network (192.168.1.0) into two separate `/25` subnets.
* **Key Concepts:**
    * Subnetting
    * Basic Router & Switch Configuration
    * IP Address assign-ment
    * Inter-Subnet Routing

### 2. Subnetting (3 Subnets)

* **File:** `[Subnetting_Lab_2.pkt]` 
* **Description:** This scenario involves subnetting a `/24` network (192.168.1.0) into three `/26` subnets.
* **Key Concepts:**
    * Subnetting (/26 mask)
    * Multi-Router Topology
    * IP configuration for LANs and a point-to-point (Router-to-Router) link.
    * End-to-end connectivity test.
